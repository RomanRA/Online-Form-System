Online Forms System
Currently Coastal Carolina University uses paper forms to manage course information data, and process student requests. The Goal of this project is to replace the manual paper form process for Coastal Carolina University with an online substitute which works in a similar manner. The objective is to streamline the forms process, increase efficiency, decrease time to completion, and achieve more accurate reporting, accurate record keeping.

Information collection techniques
Studying of the existing business procedures and forms
We reviewed many if not all of the forms that Coastal Carolina University currently has from general permission to course repeat forms. These were valuable resources because we were able to obtain an understanding of the current business practice and procedures of the forms process at the college and the input and output of each of those processes.

User Interviewing
We conducted interviews at the school of those would be most likely to use the forms process as well as members of the team.
